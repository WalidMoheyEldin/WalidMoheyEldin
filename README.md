# Bio

Since 2006, I have gained extensive expertise in software development, project management, and solution architecture, demonstrating a consistent ability to deliver top-tier desktop, web, and mobile applications using a diverse range of programming technologies, including C#.NET, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, Web API, .NET Core, React JS, Xamarin, Blazor, and Microsoft Azure.

In addition, I have a strong proficiency in Agile methodologies and project management, having utilized Azure DevOps extensively to drive successful project delivery. Furthermore, my skills extend to Microsoft Power Platform, including Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI, which I have used to build robust and scalable solutions for clients.

My extensive portfolio includes e-commerce, sales order processing, CRM, and company websites, among others. Previously, I held roles as a Senior Software Developer and Software Engineer Technical Lead. Driven and result oriented, I excel in delivering complex projects in a timely and efficient manner.
